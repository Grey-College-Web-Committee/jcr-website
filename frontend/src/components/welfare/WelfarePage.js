If Iâ€™m not busy with my current hyper-fixation of the week, or mid giving my friends an overly detailed rundown of my current thoughts, then youâ€™ll usually catch me reading, listening to music, or working down at the Queens Head. Iâ€™m overjoyed to be on the Welfare team as Iâ€™m always happy to lend an ear, or simply have a good olâ€™ chit chat!",
  "SABBAGH": "Hello Iâ€™m Riannah and Iâ€™ll be one of your welfare officers this year ðŸ™‚ . I study psychology and you can usually find me in the Billy B drinking multiple iced lattes or in Grey bar eating toasties. Iâ€™m always up for a chat so if you see me around college donâ€™t feel afraid to say Hi! Iâ€™m so excited to be a part of the welfare team this year!",
  "GRIFFITHS": "Hey! Iâ€™m Cerys. Iâ€™m a second year English Literature student and Iâ€™m so, so excited to be on the Welfare Team this year. If Iâ€™m not avoiding my endless list of reading in the Billy B cafÃ©, youâ€™ll find me enjoying a pint at The Elm or attempting to play football with GCWFC. Please feel free to come and say hi- I love a good chat and will always be up for a cup of tea!",
  "BODDINGTON": "Hi I'm Tom. I'm a third year engineering student and you can usually find me skipping a 9am or around grey. I'm excited to be on welfare to support anyone wether that be through drop ins, or stealing lolly's for people. I'm always down for a chat so just say hi.",
  "MOULD": "Hii, My name is Izzy and I study Anthropology. If Iâ€™m not working in Victor Watts, youâ€™ll probably find me floating about on the Wear attempting to row, blasting out music in headphones that donâ€™t fit me or drinking endless cups of Yorkshire tea ðŸ™‚. Iâ€™m so happy to be a part of the welfare team and if you see me wandering around Durham, donâ€™t hesitate to stop me for a chit chat or a coffee!",
  "HYAMS": "Hey there, Iâ€™m Zach and I am studying Environmental Geosciences. Iâ€™m very excited to be on the welfare team this year and I look forward to engaging with fellow college members both living in and living out of college this year. Iâ€™m sure you will manage to find me in the Grey College bar most weeks with friends. Iâ€™m always happy for a chat so if you see me round Durham please do come over and say hello.",
  "TAN": "Heya Iâ€™m Carmen! As a first-year law student, youâ€™ll find me haunting the Palatine with a caramel latte in hand. I'm so excited to create a safe and inclusive space for everyone. Besides that, I'm an international student, disabled, and queer - so if you'd like to talk about those in particular, I've been through it too and I'm happy to offer support. Ignore my resting grumpy face and reach out if you want a chat!",
  "REES": "Hi! I'm Amelia, and I'm really looking forward to being one of your welfare officers this year. I'm a first year studying Chemistry. Aside from my degree, you can usually find me at one of the many theatre productions, house of phoenix events or in the JCR having toasties. I'm always up for a chat, so don't be afraid to come say hi if you see me around Grey ðŸ™‚.",
  "KELLY": "Hi Iâ€™m Georgia, Iâ€™m a first year geography student and one of your welfare officers. You can usually find me (unsuccessfully) defending my degree as more than colouring in or working on my terrifying pint time. Feel free to come say hello, Iâ€™m always up for a chatâ€¦or some chopping tips!",
  "MITSIOS": "Heyhey! My name is Xandros and I am a 2nd year Psychology student. I would summarise my personality into films, travelling, cooking and procrastinating. You probably know me as the chattiest person in Grey so please do come to any drop-ins for a chat or supplies! Be Kind and Stay safe :)"

              <ul className="my-1 list-inside list-disc">
                <li>Request information like leaflets, names of charities, phone numbers etc.</li>

              <p className="mb-2">The new Welfare team will be picked during the second term of the year (Epiphany). The Senior Officers are elected in second term and anyone can run. If you would like to apply to be on the Welfare team or run for the role as a Welfare Officer feel free to get in touch with the current team to answer any questions you might have.</p>
              <h3 className="text-left font-semibold text-xl mb-1">Nightline</h3>
              <p className="mb-2">Nightline is a listening service run by students for students and is open Tuesday - Saturday nights between 9pm and 7am during term time. They are there to listen to you about anything on your mind such as friends, relationships, stress, late night thoughts, and more.</p>
              <p className="mb-2">Nightline is based on 5 principles: confidentiality, anonymity, non-advisory, non-judgmental, and non-aligned. So, you can be assured that every conversation remains between the caller and volunteer and that your identity will remain anonymous. As well, they are non-directive/non-advisory respecting your right to make your own decisions, and are both non-judgmental and non-aligned respecting each person's thoughts, beliefs, and actions.</p>
              <p className="mb-2">You can contact them by calling their number which is found on the back of your campus card or online via their instant messaging system which can be found <a className="font-semibold underline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://durhamnightline.com/">on their website.</a></p>
