You can normally find me attempting to play mixed lacrosse, hunting for some mandarin yogurts in the canteen or in the Billy B reading Austen! Iâ€™m so excited to be on the welfare team this year and getting more involved in life at Grey!",
  "SPILLANE": "Hi, my name is Scarlett and I study Natural Sciences. You will find me in the library or TLC trying to do my summatives, or in Jimmyâ€™s or Grey bar, avoiding themâ€¦. Iâ€™m so happy to be part of the welfare team again this year, as one of your senior welfare officers.",
  "SAUNDERS": "Hi Iâ€™m Charlie, Iâ€™m a first year philosophy student and one of your welfare officers this year! Please feel free to say hello, you can usually find me in the greyhound annoying Nic or sending cute cow photos to my friends!",
  "CUNNINGHAM": "Hiii, my name is Paris and I study Psychology. If Iâ€™m not busy with my current hyper-fixation of the week, or mid giving my friends an overly detailed rundown of my current thoughts, then youâ€™ll usually catch me reading, listening to music, or working at the SU bar/cafÃ©. Iâ€™m overjoyed to be on the Welfare team as Iâ€™m always happy to lend an ear, or simply have a good olâ€™ chit chat!",
  "KWAN": "Hi! I'm Olga and I do Philosophy and Psychology. You can usually find me hanging out around the theatres in Durham! You can come talk to me about anything but especially queer or international student-related things â€“ I'm also fluent in Cantonese and Mandarin, for those who feel more comfortable speaking in their native language.",
  "CLARK": "Hi Iâ€™m Phoebe and Iâ€™m a modern languages student studying German and Spanish. Iâ€™m so excited to be part of the welfare team this year, and when Iâ€™m back from my year abroad, you might find me attempting to play netball or cox, but more likely Iâ€™ll be tucking into a toastie in the JCR ðŸ™‚",
  "DONALDSON": "Hey everyone! Iâ€™m Jess and Iâ€™m one of your welfare officers this year! I study history and aside from complaining about how much I hate my degree, you can usually find me on various committees around college or getting involved with college events. Iâ€™m always up for a chat so feel free to have a natter whenever you see me around! ðŸ™‚",
  "BODDINGTON": "Hey guys Iâ€™m Tom and I study engineering! Iâ€™m so excited to be a welfare member this year and be more involved with people around college despite living out. Whilst Iâ€™m usually skipping a 9am lecture you can also find me doing some form of sport or bingeing random shows. Iâ€™m always up for a chat so feel to say hi.",
  "GADIAN": "Hi, my name is Georgie and Iâ€™m a Londoner studying Classics here at Grey. You can always find me walking across Kingsgate bridge or on Level 1 of the Billy B - however, as Iâ€™m chatty but short, if Iâ€™m with friends youâ€™ll probably hear me before you see me! Iâ€™m really looking forward to being on the Welfare team this year and Iâ€™m always up for a coffee and a chat!",
  "SABBAGH": "Hello Iâ€™m Riannah and Iâ€™ll be one of your welfare officers this year ðŸ™‚ . I study psychology and you can usually find me in the Billy B drinking multiple iced lattes or in Grey bar eating toasties. Iâ€™m always up for a chat so if you see me around college donâ€™t feel afraid to say Hi! Iâ€™m so excited to be a part of the welfare team this year!"

You could report an incident (such as egging, drink spiking) to enable us to warn other students about it. You could ask us a question if you prefer not to talk directly. Or you can simply use it as an easy way of sending us your thoughts. Here are a few of the things you might want to write about:</p>
              <ul className="my-1 list-inside list-disc">
                <li>Request information like leaflets, names of charities, phone numbers etc.</li>

                <li>Suggest how we could improve campaign weeks (SHAG week, Stressless, Alcohol Awareness)</li>
                <li>Request certain supplies, and we can leave it in a discreet place for you.</li>

              <h3 className="text-left font-semibold text-xl mb-1">College Welfare Team</h3>
              <p className="mb-2">Would you like to get involved in welfare? Whilst at Durham, there are several opportunities to get involved in welfare: be at Grey, through Nightline or Durham SU.</p>
              <p className="mb-2">The new Welfare team will be picked during the second term of the year (Epiphany). The Senior Officers are elected in second term and anyone can run. If you would like to apply to be on the Welfare team or run for the role as a Welfare Officer feel free to get in touch with the current team to answer any questions you might have.</p>
              <h3 className="text-left font-semibold text-xl mb-1">Nightline</h3>
              <p className="mb-2">Nightline is a listening service run by students for students and is open every night of term between 9pm and 7am. They are there to listen to you about anything on your mind such as friends, relationships, stress, late night thoughts, and more.</p>
              <p className="mb-2">Nightline is based on 5 principles: confidentiality, anonymity, non-advisory, non-judgmental, and non-aligned. So, you can be ensured that every conversation remains between the caller and volunteer and that your identity will remain anonymous. As well, they are non-directive/non-advisory respecting your right to make your own decisions, and are both non-judgmental and non-aligned respecting each person's thoughts, beliefs, and actions.</p>
              <p className="mb-2">You can contact them by calling their number which is found on the back of your campus card or online via their instant messaging system which can be found <a className="font-semibold underline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://durhamnightline.com/">on their website.</a></p>
