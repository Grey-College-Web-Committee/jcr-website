So, you can be ensured that every conversation remains between the caller and volunteer and that your identity will remain anonymous. As well, they are non-directive/non-advisory respecting your right to make your own decisions, and are both non-judgmental and non-aligned respecting each person's thoughts, beliefs, and actions.</p>
                <p className="mb-2">You can contact them by calling their number which is found on DUO and the back of your campus card or online via their instant messaging system which can be found on <a href="https://durhamnightline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline font-semibold">their website</a></p>
