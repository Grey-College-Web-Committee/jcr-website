# Grey College JCR - New Website
## Setup
This setup guide will go through and explain how to setup the website locally assuming that you have not installed any previous software etc. If you already have a database on your computer or Node installed then those steps can be skipped but changes may need to be made to the .env file.
1. Download and install Node.js (includes npm) https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Download and install MySQL via XAMPP https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
4. Download and install Python https://www.python.org/downloads/ (only necessary if you wish to use the simplified setup.py script which is recommended)
3. Download the repository locally via GitHub (GitHub Desktop is an easy client to use https://desktop.github.com/)
4. Open XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL
5. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin, click 'New' on the left-hand side
6. Create a new database, make note of the name e.g. grey-website
7. Run setup.py on (requires Python 3.6+) and follow the prompts (add stuff about emails)
8. Inside the server folder, open new a terminal and run 'npm install'.
9. Once it is complete, run 'npm start' in the server folder. This will start the server and create the necessary tables.
10. Inside the frontend folder, open new a terminal and run 'npm install'.
11. Once it is complete, run 'npm start' in the frontend folder. This will open the page in your default web browser.

This should get the site up and running locally.

Leave the server and frontend running while developing. Both have hot-reloading so you can just develop without worrying about restarting either. Although if the server is reloaded sessions do not persist so it will log you out.
